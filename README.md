## Simple code editor for web development written in VB.net

The first version of this program was developed when I was learning Visual Basic in 2012 and it was improved in 2015. Most people say the time of Visual Basic is over and it is not popular now. However, if you checked [TIOBE Index for August 2020](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/ "Click here"), VB is in 6th position. This source code is published for beginners who are learning VB.net. This code is very simple and not organized very well. Another problem is there are hard-coded line in this code. You can improve this by

- Solving compatibility issues
- Remvoing hard-coded lines and adding suitable code to manage config data.
- Refactoring code and adding new features.

The last build is still working in Windows 10 with .NET 4.6. Current features include

- Ready-made snippets.
- View in the default browser and other browsers. Add new browsers
- HTML tag explorer for creating HTML elements quickly. Thank you.

Thank you.
